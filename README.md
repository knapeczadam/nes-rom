# NES-ROM

Initial NES emulator development for the **Retro Console & Emulator Programming** course at **Howest DAE**. Developed in **6502 Assembly**.  

This project was later replaced by [NESlides](https://github.com/knapeczadam/retro-console-and-emulator-programming-neslides) due to technical challenges.
